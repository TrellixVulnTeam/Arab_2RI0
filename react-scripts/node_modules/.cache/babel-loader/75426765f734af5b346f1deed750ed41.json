I'm so very, very happy with the quality of the code and the use of best practices. I've been able to modify existing components and make updates that are required for my use case with absolute ease. I've only started to explore the Figma components, but having them available is a big deal for us and we will utilize them more in upcoming development efforts. I've personally learned a great deal by studying and exploring this kit. This has been well worth the effort and I'm very satisfied.\"},{name:'Tien Phan',date:'November 3, 2020',feedback:\"This is one of the best purchases I have EVER made.
